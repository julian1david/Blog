                    <h1>Chewbacca </h1>
                    <p>During one of their smuggling attempts at the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Millennium
                        Falcon was boarded and the two lost the cargo that they were hauling for their usual employer,
                        Jabba the Hutt. Arriving at Mos Eisley on Tatooine to speak with Jabba about the lost cargo,
                        they sat down in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. At the bar, Chewbacca was approached by Ben
                        Kenobi, who was searching for passage for himself, Luke Skywalker and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO
                        to Alderaan. Promised 2,000 credits in advance and an additional 15,000 upon arrival to
                        Alderaan, Solo and Chewbacca agreed to the commission</p>

                    <p> In Docking Bay 94, Solo and Chewbacca found Jabba waiting for them with a crew of hired
                        help.[41] One of them, the famous bounty hunter Boba Fett, kept an eye on Chewbacca, noting the
                        Wookiee getting ready for a fight as Solo spoke with Jabba. Thus, he moved his arm enough to
                        ensure the Wookiee braids he wore were visible to Chewbacca, which the Wookiee decided to show
                        no reaction to.[41] Ultimately, Solo managed to convince Jabba to give him more time. After a
                        brief firefight with stormtroopers, the Falcon left Tatooine with its new passengers, escaping
                        from Imperial vessels before entering hyperspace.</p>

                    <p> During the hyperspace journey, while Kenobi trained Skywalker in the use of the Force, Chewbacca
                        played a game of dejarik with R2-D2, who made a move that Chewbacca disliked. C-3PO advised that
                        the move was technically fair, and even chided Chewbacca, at which point Solo advised them not
                        to anger the Wookiee because of his species' tendency to pull arms out of their sockets,
                        prompting the two droids to surrende
